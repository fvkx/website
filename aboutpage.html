            <p>
                The <strong>Disaster Preparedness Portal</strong> is an online platform dedicated to helping
                individuals, communities, and institutions anticipate, prepare for, and respond to natural and man-made
                disasters. It serves as a centralized hub that brings together vital information, tools, and best
                practices for effective disaster management.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website was <strong>developed by a team of IT students from St. Rita’s College of
                    Balingasag</strong> as part of their community-oriented initiative. It is specifically designed for
                <strong>Barangay 3, Calacalá, Balingasag, Misamis Oriental</strong>, aiming to enhance local
                preparedness, awareness, and coordination during emergencies. Through this platform, residents can
                access real-time updates, safety guidelines, and communication resources to ensure a safer and more
                resilient community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our mission is to ensure every resident is informed and ready to respond effectively during emergencies.
                By combining technology and local coordination, we aim to reduce risks, prevent misinformation, and
                promote safety across the community.
